* [camera enhancer](https://tony-xlh.github.io/Vanilla-JS-Barcode-Reader-Demos/autozoom/index.html). Use [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/core/introduction/) to open the camera and control zoom based on the detected barcode location.
* [getUserMedia](https://tony-xlh.github.io/Vanilla-JS-Barcode-Reader-Demos/autozoom/getUserMedia.html). Use WebRTC's getUserMedia to open the camera and control zoom directly based on the detected barcode location.

Both demos use [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) to read barcodes.
